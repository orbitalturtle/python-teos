class ChainMonitor:
    """
    The :class:`ChainMonitor` is in charge of monitoring the blockchain (via ``bitcoind``) to detect new blocks on top
    of the best chain. If a new best block is spotted, the chain monitor will notify the
    :obj:`Watcher <teos.watcher.Watcher>` and the :obj:`Responder <teos.responder.Responder>` using ``Queues``.

    The :class:`ChainMonitor` monitors the chain using two methods: ``zmq`` and ``polling``. Blocks are only notified
    once per queue and the notification is triggered by the method that detects the block faster.

    Args:
        watcher_queue (:obj:`Queue`): the queue to be used to send blocks hashes to the ``Watcher``.
        responder_queue (:obj:`Queue`): the queue to be used to send blocks hashes to the ``Responder``.
        block_processor (:obj:`BlockProcessor <teos.block_processor.BlockProcessor>`): a ``BlockProcessor`` instance.
        bitcoind_feed_params (:obj:`dict`): a dict with the feed (ZMQ) connection parameters.

    Attributes:
        best_tip (:obj:`str`): a block hash representing the current best tip.
        last_tips (:obj:`list`): a list of last chain tips. Used as a sliding window to avoid notifying about old tips.
        terminate (:obj:`bool`): a flag to signal the termination of the :class:`ChainMonitor` (shutdown the tower).
        check_tip (:obj:`Event`): an event that is triggered at fixed time intervals and controls the polling thread.
        lock (:obj:`Condition`): a lock used to protect concurrent access to the queues and ``best_tip`` by the zmq and
            polling threads.
        zmqSubSocket (:obj:`socket`): a socket to connect to ``bitcoind`` via ``zmq``.
        watcher_queue (:obj:`Queue`): a queue to send new best tips to the :obj:`Watcher <teos.watcher.Watcher>`.
        responder_queue (:obj:`Queue`): a queue to send new best tips to the
            :obj:`Responder <teos.responder.Responder>`.
        polling_delta (:obj:`int`): time between polls (in seconds).
        max_block_window_size (:obj:`int`): max size of last_tips.
        block_processor (:obj:`BlockProcessor <teos.block_processor.BlockProcessor>`): a blockProcessor instance.
